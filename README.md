## What is DevOps? What do DevOps developers do?
- DevOps is a set of practices. It is a culture within a team or company. Many people are quick to define DevOps by lsiting off a laundry list of technologies but that's not correct at all. DevOps is the practice and those technologies are the tools that help us achieve a DevOps Environment.
- It is a combination of thing's, it's a mix of the practices and tools used to increase the delivery and deployment of software. A DevOps team tries to simplify and automate each step in the software lifecycle just to make everything faster and give developers peace of mind during lifecycle steps.

- Improved delivery
