# DevOps-Learning-Path
This repository is a step-by-step daily plan to get a BETTER understanding of everything DevOps from Foundations, to Kubernetes all the way to Reliability &amp; SRE. I am doing this just to refresh up on certain topics, going at my own pace following my own learning path.

## What is DevOps? What do DevOps developers do?
- DevOps is a set of practices. It is a culture within a team or company. Many people are quick to define DevOps by lsiting off a laundry list of technologies but that's not correct at all. DevOps is the practice and those technologies are the tools that help us achieve a DevOps Environment.
- It is a combination of thing's, it's a mix of the practices and tools used to increase the delivery and deployment of software. A DevOps team tries to simplify and automate each step in the software lifecycle just to make everything faster and give developers peace of mind during lifecycle steps.
  
## What are the benefits of DevOps?
- Collaboration across teams (Devs, QA, etc.)
- Improved delivery
- Security
- Speed
- Scale
- Reliability
- Automated development cycle
- Ease of use
- Markup costs for companies on finding bugs early on

## 💻 Programming 

### [Golang](https://roadmap.sh/golang) 
- For this learning path, I want to keep up with the current demands of common programming languages for a DevOps/SRE role. I narrowed the options down to Python and Go, and since I'm already familiar with Python, I have decided to learn Go throughout this learning path.
- [Go Bootcamp](https://one2n.io/go-bootcamp)
- [Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/list) - An interactive tour of Go that covers the most important features like the basics, methods and interfaces, generics, and concurrency.

## 🐧 Operating System

### [Linux Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/linux)
- It was a no brainer choosing Linux (Ubuntu) as the OS for my learning path, mainly because it supports a more user-friendly experience, and a focus on ease of use specifically for system administration tasks.
- [Security Concepts](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) - An interactive game to practice security concepts.
